            QHale's Boxer Adoption was started by a couple whose life was changed after adopting a boxer named Little Man. The couple could clearly see Little Man came from some place that didn't treat him well as he was scared of abnormal things such as buses, grating on sidewalks, umbrellas and much, much more. With a lot of training and love, Little Man slowly began to learn not everything in the world was bad. His happiness and personality was clearly seen by family, friends and acquaintances, influencing at least five adoptions. Since then, the coupon has decided to try to reach out and let the world know how amazing a boxer can be to include in your family!
