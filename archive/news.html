              Today was the day that Samson picked his new forever family. Megan and Tim are experienced Boxer owners. After suffering the loss of their second Boxer they weren't sure if they could go through that pain again, so they rescued Lucy the Catahoula. As with most people owned by a Boxer, they decided they needed another wiggly and silly snuggle bug in their lives. Along came Samson, your typical silly young Boxer boy. The pups met today and were instant BFF's. They ran and played together for almost an hour. Samson also gained three skin siblings that will keep him entertained. This will be one busy home, full of love, games, and snuggles. Thank you for adopting Meagan and Tim. You have got yourselves one amazing Boxer boy and he gained a wonderful family to grow up with.

              The Graham family braved traffic today in hopes of adopting Charlie 4. Charlie did not disappoint -- he saw the kids and headed straight for them. He was all kisses, cuddles, and tricks for his new brothers, Isaac and Owen. It was a unanimous decision that Charlie was going home with his new family. Thank you, Graham family, for adopting this sweet fellow, and welcome to the Northwest Boxer Rescue family.

              Look who has become a Canuck? Astro says, "Eh man, I've been adopted by the best family ever in Canada." Astro gained a new fur brother to play with and he loves him already. He also gained human siblings to play with and teach him how to be a good puppy. His new mom and dad are amazing and he especially loves his new dad. He will get to go on many outings to watch sporting events, and go hiking and camping. Thank you for adopting Dawn
